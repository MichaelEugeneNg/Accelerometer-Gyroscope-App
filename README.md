# Accelerometer-Gyroscope-App
Mobile web app to access and measure accelerometer and gyroscope readings from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in phones / tablets. 

### Frontend: React.js
React router is used to route from HomePage → InstructionPage → CountdownPage → MeasurePage
MeasurePage sends two async fetches to a FastAPI, sending a payload with the following fields:

1. ```user_id```: UUID
2. ```measured_at```: the time that the data was measured
3. ```sensor_type```: "accel" or "gyro"
4. ```data```: an array of dictionaries ordered by timestamp\
a) accel looks like [{"ts": _, "x": _, "y": _, "z": _}, ..., {"ts": _, "x": _, "y": _, "z": _}]\
b) gyro looks like [{"ts": _, "alpha": _, "beta": _, "gamma": _}, ..., {"ts": _, "alpha": _, "beta": _, "gamma": _}]

### Backend: FastAPI
The backend is implemented in Python FastAPI, and follows a REST API framework which enable POST / GET behavior of accelerometer and gyroscope readings to / from a PostgreSQL database. Python functions in ```utils.py``` are used in ```crud.py``` to create an additional column, "metrics", which contains relevant information about the data stream being sent from the frontend. The final information being posted to the database includes the "metrics" field in addition to the fields from the frontend.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
